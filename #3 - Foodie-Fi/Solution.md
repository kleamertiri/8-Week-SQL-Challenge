<summary>A. Customer Journey</summary>
<hr/>
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

```sql
WITH CTE_customer_description AS (
		SELECT customer_id, plan_name, start_date, price
		FROM subscriptions AS s
		INNER JOIN plans AS p
		ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
		WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
)

SELECT *
FROM CTE_customer_description
-- Selecting each customer one by one
WHERE customer_id = *
```
